Embrace's Unity SDK lets you bring the deep, introspective and native debugging power of Embrace into your Unity game or application.

## Getting Started
The Unity documentation can be found [here](https://embrace.io/docs/unity/).

- [Go to our dashboard](https://dash.embrace.io/signup/) to create an account and get your API key
- Check our [guide](https://embrace.io/docs/unity/integration/) to integrate the SDK into your Unity project

## Building
It is important to note that the Unity SDK WILL NOT COMPILE after pulling down. This is because it depends directly on the [Apple SDK](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-apple-sdk), and statically links to the xcframeworks as part of the build process.

To build, download the latest SUPPORTED release of the Apple SDK and place the xcframeworks in the `Embrace Unity iOS Interface/xcframeworks/`. Then run the script `build_xcframework.sh` to construct the missing Unity specific xcframework. You can then import all of these xcframeworks, including the newly generated xcframework, into your Unity project.

## Usage

- Refer to our [Features page](https://embrace.io/docs/unity/features/) to learn about the features Embrace SDK provides

## Support & Contributions
Embrace does not currently accept pull requests from external contributors. If you have a feature suggestion or have spotted something that doesn't look right please reach out in ourÂ [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/embraceio-community/shared_invite/zt-ywr4jhzp-DLROX0ndN9a0soHMf6Ksow) for direct, faster assistance.
