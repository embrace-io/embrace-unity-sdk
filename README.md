Embrace's Unity SDK lets you bring the deep, introspective and native debugging
power of Embrace into your Unity game or application.

## Getting Started

The Unity documentation can be found [here](https://embrace.io/docs/unity/).

- [Go to our dashboard](https://dash.embrace.io/signup/) to create an account
  and get your API key
- Check our [guide](https://embrace.io/docs/unity/integration/) to integrate the
  SDK into your Unity project

## Building

It is important to note that the Unity SDK is not usable immediately after
cloning the repository. This is because it depends directly on the
[Apple SDK](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-apple-sdk), and statically
links to the xcframeworks as part of the build process.

To build the SDK, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
make
```

This will automatically pull down the dependencies and build the Unity
xcframeworks, and copy everything into the io.embrace.sdk folder. Unfortunately,
it is not currently possible to invoke the required iOS specific commands on
Windows. This pipeline requires xcpretty (`gem install xcpretty`) and the XCode
Build Tools to be installed.

If you run into any issues building the SDK locally, please reach out on our
[community Slack](https://embraceio-community.slack.com/archives/C078WQ3DJMC)!
